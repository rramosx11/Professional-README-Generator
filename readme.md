## [Description](#table-of-contents)

This project is a README generator. The project will help a user generate a README.MD file without having to worry about the minor details.

The README is just as important as the code and it is sometimes overlooked. Having a descriptive and professional README will leave a positive first impression on recruiters and other visitors when they are viewing projects in your GitHub profile.

This README generator will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses. This will provide the developer with the ability to make their project complete and more professional, increasing the likely hood that someone will want to use their app or leave a great impression on recruiters.

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

Please download the files from the link below. You can copy these files to a directory in your local computer, or you can also clone it to directory. Open the file in VS Code. You want to make sure that Inqurier and Node are installed in your directory.

[Inquirer-Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

After installation is complete, run the following code: ‘node index’ in the terminal. Answer the prompts and after completion, you should see a console log showing your answers to your prompts, a message that says ‘File created!’, and you should see your file called ‘generated-README’. It’s generated in mark down syntax so you can copy and paste that code into your project!

I have also included a video with a demo of the project, and I also provided two screenshots. One image is if you have a project that uses a license, and the other image will demonstrate how the readme looks like if you have no license.
